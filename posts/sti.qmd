The Statistics Teaching Inventory (STI) is an instrument designed to assess the instructional practices and beliefs of instructors of introductory statistics courses.

1.  Pedagogy;
2.  Curricular emphasis;
3.  Technology;
4.  Assessment;
5.  Beliefs;
6.  Course characteristics; and
7.  Instructor/institutional characteristics.
